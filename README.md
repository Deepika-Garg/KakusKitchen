### Typography
The font-families chosen are montserrat and Lora. For consistency I used montserrat for headings and titles and Lora was used for the text on the body and cards body.

### Imagery
Imagery plays a very important part in the design for this website. I chose bright colourful tempting food images that complimented each other on the page. I added a hoover effect on the images of home page to give it more life. Images are taken from [StockAdobe](https://stock.adobe.com/uk/). Images on the menu page are taken from the actual business called Kaku's Kitchen, based in Penarth. 

Reason for design - I went with a basic yet responsive design that will be inviting to all users of the website aswell as giving out all the relevent information.
